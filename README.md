# ByeByeAi

**🚧 Heavy Work in Progress**

Browser extension to filter out the AI slop on LinkedIn. I got tired of reading ai copy and pastes, so I built this to filter all that.

**Tech & Features**
- **AI Score:** Gives every post a probability score.
- **Fun UI:** Planning to make detected posts disintegrate/fly away as you scroll.
- **Modular:** Built to easily swap in better models later.

**Issues & Next Steps**
- I need a better dataset to fine-tune this. The hard part is getting a massive volume of verified human vs. AI posts without manually reviewing 10k entries or getting rate-limited.
- **UI:** Animations are currently just placeholders.
